Hosted version
==============

Running under Apache / any static webserver
===========================================

Simply serve this project directory as public html, with `index.html` as the
entry point.


Running with Node
=================

You can run this with node quite happily. Simply execute `node-http-server.js`
under Linux, or run `node .` in the directory. Node that the app is fully
static, and does not require node to function.

Running on OpenShift
====================

Works just fine with the [Node] S2I builder in OpenShift (tested with v4.2). If
you want to select a builder, then "JS modern web app" should work.
